# Introduction
Welcome to the one-stop shop for everything DevOps! My goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for DevOps professionals, covering all the latest best practices, tools, and techniques. We believe that the sharing of knowledge and collaboration is key to driving innovation and growth in the DevOps space. Join us on this journey and help build a better future for DevOps!

In terms of topics to include, here are some suggestions:

1. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
3. Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)
4. Monitoring and logging
5. Automated testing
6. Security and Compliance
7. Cloud computing (AWS, Azure, GCP)
8. Scaling and Performance Optimization
9. DevOps Culture and Collaboration
10. Emerging trends and new technologies in DevOps.

These are just a few of the topics you can include in your repository. You can also consider adding tutorials, guides, case studies, and other resources that can help DevOps professionals learn and grow in their careers.




## Chicken and egg problem
Automating your infrastructure is a great idea, but you need infrastructure to automate your infrastructure. There are three approaches to doing this:
- Clicking in the console to set everything up, aka ["ClickOps"](https://www.buildon.aws/concepts/devops-essentials/#clickops)
- Using a CLI to create the resources for you with scripts, ["Procedural"](https://www.buildon.aws/concepts/devops-essentials/#procedural)
- Using Terraform without storing the state file to bootstrap, then add in the state file configurations to store it
- We will be using the 3rd option, have a look at the [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47913041/initial-setup-of-terraform-backend-using-terraform/) discussion around approaches for more details on the trade-offs.
